Tools for maintaining AOSP and QAEP mirror server (gitweb & repo) 

* gen_gitweb_list.sh
  It's a handy script for generating project.list file for gitweb.
  Made for AOSP mirror.

* get_qaep_new_manifest.sh
  QAEP do not provide up-to-date manifest.xml of the whole repositories, 
  you have to manually add the specific path in the manifest.xml when new
  release comes in and that's really annoying.
  This script gets the full project list from codeaurora.org, then generates 
  new manifest.xml automatically if new repository is available.

Any questions feel free contact me :-)
